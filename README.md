# CODE-OF-CONDUCT - Devathon
---------------------------------------
Devathon is 24 hour hackathon. The hackathon aims to create a an environment where developers, enginners and designers can collaborate and develop a product as a team  so that they can build products which help the society and people's needs.

#### Be considerate
Any decision you take will affect other members and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Try to make decisions that are as inclusive as possible.
#### Be respectful
Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect members/participants of the event to be respectful when communicating with other community members, as well as with people outside the Community.
#### Be Collaborative
What we produce is a complex whole made of many parts, it is the sum of many dreams. Collaboration between teams that each have their own goal and vision is essential; for the whole to be more than the sum of its parts, each part must make an effort to understand the whole.  

Collaboration reduces redundancy and improves the quality of our work. Internally and externally, we celebrate good collaboration. Wherever possible, we work closely with [Mar Athanasius College of Engineering](http:/mace.ac.in/) and other startups and communities with the open-source and non-profit motto to coordinate our efforts. We prefer to work transparently and involve interested parties as early as possible.
#### Be nice and Do not harass others  
Everyone in this community should feel welcome, regardless of their background. Please be courteous, respectful and polite to fellow community members. Any complaints regrading any of the following will be taken seriously and may result in removing from the community/Event.  
Harassment includes:
- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness,  physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact through texts without consent or after a request to stop.
- Threats of violence.
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
- Deliberate intimidation.
- Stalking or Following.
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
- Sustained disruption of discussion.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.  
ie. Meetup organizing members and other volunteer members should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.

If asked to stop any harassing behavior, you are expected to comply immediately. If a participant/member engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.  
**If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please follow the directions in the "Contact us" section, at the end of this document.**  
Organizers will be happy to help participants/members contact security or local law enforcement, provide escorts to an alternate location, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We value your attendance.  

We expect participants to follow these rules at our all of our event venues and event-related social events.  
#### Communicate effectively
Clear communication can help to avoid misunderstandings, Having context is important. It's better to ask for clarification than to make assumptions. Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we expect members in the community to resolve disagreements constructively — so please avoid flamewars, trolling, personal attacks, and repetitive arguments.
#### Unaffilated Promotions
Any promotions which are not directly affiliated to the event should be completely avoided, if found continuing even after asked to stop may result in removal from the event/community. All the members/organizers/sponsors/participants shall ask permission with  concerned people mentioned at the end of the document to carry-out any promotions within the community discussion rooms or events.
#### When we disagree, try to understand why.
Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and the Meenachil Hacks is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of the event comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively and with the help of the community and community processes.When our goals differ dramatically, we encourage the creation of alternative implementations, so that the community can test new ideas and contribute to the discussion.
#### Go by This
If any member is unwilling to abide by this Code of Conduct or breaks it, he/she shall be removed from their current activity and will be given a **final chance** .If there seems no improvment the person will be removed from the whole event and will not be allowed to participate or contribute to any furthur activity whatever his designation be.
